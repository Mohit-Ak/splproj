## About SPL Tours
The initial venture into the world of unmatched tourism was taken by Mr.Prakasam Santhanam who founded SPL Thai Tours & Transport in the year 2005. The Head office was located at 8/87 moo 6, Nakluea, Bangamung, Chon Buri, Thailand-21050, which in itself is a breathtaking and lively destination. Since then SPL tours have been a pro at creating touristic packages, determining the needs of various categories of clients, and making travel arrangements (accommodation, VISA, transport, meals, tours, insurance, and so on). SPL consultants are travel addicts themselves and so they possess commendable interpersonal skills, a genuine interest in touristic locations, speaks at least one foreign language, and have an approachable attitude. Currently, we still carry the startup culture and welcome you personally at the Airports with our caravans. In 2016, Mr. Ramakrishnan has taken a great tour leap by establishing another branch of SPL Tours in Chennai, India. This venture would make it more accessible for all the globetrotters to approach us and unveil their wanderlust. So drop in at No. 3 Muthukrishnan street, Pondybazaar, T.Nagar, Chennai - 600017, India if you wanna book tickets, exchange currency, pick, customize a package or if you like to have a masala dosa.
